# Wrangle_And_Analyze_WeRateDogs_TwitterAccount

The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for you to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

I used another dataset provided by Udacity that predict the breed of the dog based on three nurel network algorithms. I also used tweepy library to get more information about the twets like the number of retweets and favourites.


This project was from [Data Analyst Nanodegree by Udacity ](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).
